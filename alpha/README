 Maiko (VE4KLM), updated bbs10000.c, some necessary fixes in the html code,
 also the command line is now 80 characters, and on it's own 'row', easier
 to compose messages that way. Also updated ftpsubr.c to disable --more--
 prompting on HELP if you are coming in via a browser, confirmed working
 for that and if you call HELP within the convers mode at BBS prompt.

 Maiko (VE4KLM), there is a memory leak in the original alpha code, still
 not fixed, but you should know it's there. Should be in mailbox.c file.

 WARNING :

  You need to do a MASS compile, since there is a 'struct let' in
  mailbox.h that has two additional structure members added to it.

 Note there are 2 files you have to overwrite in your existing source :

     mailbox.h

     bmutil.c

NEW COMMANDS (by request) :

  KH   (kill all held messages)

  K<   (kill all messages from callsign)

  K>   (kill all messages to callsign)

This one is my idea (does not seem to save though when you exit) :

  KR   (kill message READ flag on all messages)

FIXED COMMAND - reverted back to original JNOS 1.11f :

  L>   (list message to callsign)

  L<   (list messages from callsign)

 Back in 2010, some mods were put in that probably should not have
 been put in without me better reviewing them, so sorry folks :|
