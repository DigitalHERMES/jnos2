# VERY SIMPLE PERL SCRIPT that listens for a UDP packet
# from JNOS telling it to turn PTT on or PTT off. This
# was written strictly for the VARA modem support.
#
# I have older rigs, SERIAL PORT (RTS pin) PTT works great.
#
# Can't justify spending money on interface boxes or boards.
#
# This was slapped together from bits and pieces of PERL
# code easily found all over the internet. PERL makes it
# so easy to write UDP listeners, nothing beats it ...
#
# Using the LATEST strawberry PERL on a 64 bit Windows 7 PC
