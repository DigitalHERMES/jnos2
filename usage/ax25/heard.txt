Display stations heard on ax25 interfaces

 Usage : ax heard *[ dest | digid ] all | <iface>

         ax heard save | load *[ filename ]

   * denotes an optional single argument

 Some examples below :

   ax25 h all            traditional syntax, but requires 'all' for ALL ports
   ax25 h digid rp0      NEW show stations heard via a digipeater on port rp0
   ax25 h ax0            traditional syntax, show heard on port ax0
   ax25 h dest all       show destination calls on ALL ports

 Note : 'ax25 dest' and 'ax25 hearddest' are no more - use 'ax25 heard' now.
  (the default save or load file is 'AxHeardFile' in JNOS root directory)
