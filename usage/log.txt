# 28May2020, Maiko (VE4KLM), an attempt to get away from hardcoded usage
# functions, user can customize to their own needs or wants. These files
# are read into JNOS using new function found in getusage.c source file.
#
# I just got tired of hardcoding them. The recompiles, restarts, wasting
# my time and energy trying to nail down exact words, enough already ...
