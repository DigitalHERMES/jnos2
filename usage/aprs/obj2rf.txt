 OBJ2RF

  allow JNOS to gate OBJECTS it hears on the APRS (IS) Internet System, to RF,
  but only originating from certain callsigns and or callsign patterns.

 For example to gate just objects from AB9FT and calls starting with VE4 :

    aprs calls obj2rf AB9FT VE4

 IF you want to gate traffic to RF - BE VERY CAREFULL with these filters !!!
   (you do NOT want to FLOOD your local frequencies with solid traffic)
