 WXTORF

 allow JNOS to gate WEATHER it hears on the APRS (IS) Internet System, to RF,
 but only originating from certain callsigns and or callsign patterns.

 For example, to gate only Weather packets from callsigns SP1LOP and VE3HDU :

    aprs calls wxtorf SP1LOP VE3HDU

 IF you want to gate traffic to RF - BE VERY CAREFULL with these filters !!!
   (you do NOT want to FLOOD your local frequencies with solid traffic)
