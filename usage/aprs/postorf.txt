 POSTORF

 allow JNOS to gate POSITIONS it hears on the APRS (IS) Internet System, to
 RF, but only originating from certains callsigns and or callsign patterns.

 For example, to gate position packets from callsigns starting with VE4
 and VA4, as well as the full callsigns VE3HDU and VE3JJA :

    aprs calls postorf VE4 VA4 VE3JJA VE3HDU

 IF you want to gate traffic to RF - BE VERY CAREFULL with these filters !!!
   (you do NOT want to FLOOD your local frequencies with solid traffic)
