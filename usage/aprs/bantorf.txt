 BANTORF

 tell JNOS to never gate anything it hears on the APRS (IT) Internet System,
 to RF, for certain callsigns and or callsign patterns.

 For example to ban any APRS (IS) content with my call from going out RF :

    aprs calls bantorf VE4KLM

 IF you want to gate traffic to RF - BE VERY CAREFULL with these filters !!!
   (you do NOT want to FLOOD your local frequencies with solid traffic)
