 tell JNOS to gate everything it hears on the APRS (IS) Internet System, to RF,
 for certain callsigns and or callsign patterns.

 For example, to gate APRS (IS) content from callsigns starting with VE4 as
 well as the callsigns VE3HDU and VE3JJA :

    aprs calls fwdtorf VE4 VE3JJA VE3HDU

 IF you want to gate traffic to RF - BE VERY CAREFULL with these filters !!!
   (you do NOT want to FLOOD your local frequencies with solid traffic)
