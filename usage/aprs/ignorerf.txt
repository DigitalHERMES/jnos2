 IGNORERF

 tell JNOS to simply ignore anything it hears on RF, for certain callsigns
 and or callsign patterns.

 For example, to completely ignore any APRS traffic coming from callsigns
 starting with VA4 and also from the full callsign VE4PKT :

    aprs calls ignorerf VA4 VE4PKT

 IF you want to gate traffic to RF - BE VERY CAREFULL with these filters !!!
   (you do NOT want to FLOOD your local frequencies with solid traffic)
