 MICETORF

 allow JNOS to gate MIC E it hears on the APRS (IS) Internet System, to RF,
 but only originating from certain callsigns and or callsign patterns.

 For example, to gate just MIC E traffic coming from the callsigns starting
 with VE4 and VA4, and from the full callsigns SP1LOP, VE3HDU, and VE3JJA :

    aprs calls micetorf VE4 VA4 SP1LOP VE3JJA VE3HDU

 IF you want to gate traffic to RF - BE VERY CAREFULL with these filters !!!
   (you do NOT want to FLOOD your local frequencies with solid traffic)
