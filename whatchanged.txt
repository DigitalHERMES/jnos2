 1) main.c - new log triggers code, AND using new getusage() function below :)

 2) getusage.c - brand new file so I don't have to hardcode the usage() functions
                 anymore, and be able to now edit them on the fly, without having
                 to recompile and restart all the time, this has always been time
                 consuming and frustrating for me actually, so now is the time.

 3) version.c - changed '2.0m' to '2.0m.1'

 4) makefile - added getusage.o for the new getusage source file.

 5) $JNOSROOTDIR/usage - new subdirectory to hold usage files.

     where $JNOSROOTDIR is typically just /jnos

 6) $JNOSROOTDIR/usage/log.txt - first ever usage file (for JNOS 'log' command).

 11:37 pm - finally figured out why 'log trigger add A B' crashes JNOS. You have
 to be sure to include the & (AND) or ! (OR) operator(s) in the pattern, or else
 JNOS will crash. I have put in a safe guard, warning the user that they forgot
 to include the operator(s) in the trigger pattern, then it aborts the attempt.

   for example -> log trigger add "ve4klm&forwarding&" "some jnos command"

 7) files.c - added Usagedir directory support.

June 1, 2020
------------

 8) mboxmail.c - enhanced the information available in the SID capure.

 9) axheard.c, ax25cmd.c - added code to Load and Save axheard list.

 10) jnosinstaller.c - replaced gets() with fgets() equivalent. 
      (tired of the compiler warnings, needs to be done)

 11) nntp.h - several 'unsigned' variables missing 'integer' type.

 12) tcpgate.c, tnlink.c - intermediate variables added (Jan 15) to make compiler happy.

 13) config.h.default - added #define BACKUP_AXHEARD.

 14) forward.c - cleaned up use of WINLINK_SECURE_LOGIN and B2F defines, added
     proper error checking of the j2userpassword() function.

 15) j2pwmgr/j2pwrtns.c - j2userpassword() now returns proper error if user not found.

 testing @ 10 pm - things seem okay

 16) makefile, configure - configuration version string now 02Jun2020_v1.3

 * Going over all the MULTIPLE_WL2K_CALLS changes made the past while, note :

 18) makefile, configure - configuration version string now 16Jun2020_v1.4

 19) version.c - changed '2.0m.1' to '2.0m.2'

 20) aprssrv.c - new callsign list 'winlinkcalls', why am I using the code in
     the APRSD stuff ? because it's extremely compact and useful, and elegant,
     should really separate the callsign list stuff out at some point. I wrote
     it over 12 years ago, and it's very handy code, ptrs to ptrs to ptrs ...

     Also created a new wl2kmulticalls() function, it's in there as well, since
     it needs access to the callist - it is passed a pointer to a function that
     creates portions of the winlink response message. It's a compact function,
     might appear a bit complicated - I like to use the word elegant :]

     Pointers to functions are very versatile in specific cases - such as this
     particular application for allowing JNOS to download messages for multiple
     winlink user accounts, it just seemed to fit in well - it's pretty cool.

 21) fbbfwd.c - there is no need to fake out subsequent 'To:' recipient with
     the 'Cc:' list for any of this winlink message handling, actually causes
     duplicate messages to everyone involved in certain circumstances. Winlink
     sends separate proposals for all 'To:' recipients, so there's no point.

     Commented out 'stripping section' with regard to the 'From:' field for
     the winlink message handling, not quite sure what to do about it, but I
     didn't feel it was usefull in it's present form, observe it for now ?

 22) wlauth.c - made J2ChallengeResponse() function 'thread safe' - can't use
     static buffer anymore, so I need to malloc() each response, since multiple
     responses are required to download messages for multiple winlink accounts.

     NTM : possible tiny tiny memory leak ? I'm not sure yet (it's harmless)

 23) forward.c - instead of duplicating code, move existing code into it's
     own function, so created a new wl2k_build_response() function, the one
     which also gets called in the new wl2kmulticalls() in aprssrv.c file.

     And other changes required to do the multiple winlink mailbox download.

 24) j2pwmgr/j2pwrtns.c - this one caught me good, the function j2userpasswd()
     was actually forcing a lower case on the passed callsign string, which is
     wrong, it should not be altering content of the passed argument. Couldn't
     figure out for the longest of time why the callsigns were being passed in
     lower case for the challenge responses for downloading of multiple winlink
     user accounts. In the end it was just a misplaced strlwr() function call.

 25) fixed up the usages/log.txt (the mailmsg parameters are way off) !

 26) release this one as a patch file as well on top of 2.0m or 2.0m.1 :

     tar cvzf jnos_2.0m.2_patch.tar.gz whatchanged.txt makefile configure forward.c tnlink.c config.h.default nntp.h jnosinstaller.c ax25cmd.c axheard.c mboxmail.c getusage.c  files.c main.c version.c usage aprssrv.c fbbfwd.c wlauth.c j2pwmgr/j2pwrtns.c

     cp jnos_2.0m.2_patch.tar.gz /jnos/src/rsync

  Approaching 10 am, Tuesday morning, June 16, 2020 - Winnipeg time

-------------

 27) new files, j2strings.[ch], - no more declaring strings on the fly !

 28) new file, j2KLMlists.c, finally moved lists code out of aprssrv.c, and
     the command 'aprs calls winlinkcalls' no longer exists, it's been moved
     to 'mbox winlinkcalls' instead, see item 32) further below.

 29) modified getusage function, added a prefix parameter, allowing for
     more unique help files for subcommands like 'aprs calls ...', etc.

 30) took out hardcoded usage in main.c, make sure getusage() has a prefix.

 31) aprssrv.c - callsigns lists code taken out, moved to new j2KLMlists.c

 32) mboxcmd.c - 'mbox winlinkcall' now pluralized (winlinkcalls), and calls
     the new docallslist() in j2KLMlist.c, old Wl2kcall[] and dombwl2kcall()
     not used anymore.

 33) forward.c - now using j2KLMlists.c functions to grab callsigns.

 34) aprsmsg.c and aprs.h - adjusted for new callsigns list code.

 35) version.c - changed '2.0m.2' to '2.0m.3'

 36) configure - configuration version string now 28Jun2020_v1.5

 37) makefile - added j2strings.o and j2KLMlists.o, changed configuration
     string to match item 36) above.

 38) release this one as a patch file as well on top of 2.0m or 2.0m.[1-2] :

     tar cvzf jnos_2.0m.3_patch.tar.gz whatchanged.txt makefile configure j2strings.[ch] j2KLMlists.[ch] getusage.c main.c mboxcmd.c aprssrv.c forward.c aprsmsg.c aprs.h version.c usage

     cp jnos_2.0m.3_patch.tar.gz /jnos/src/rsync

 * cleaning up official JNOS 2.0 website, focusing on JNOS installerv2.2

    removed jnosinstaller.c and installerv2.1 subdirectory from rsync area
     (old and not useful anymore)

    new installerv2.2.tar.gz file added to rsync area

   remove jnosinstaller.c from makefile, now part of installer package
   post note : 03Aug2020, done !

 * source and installer release history also on JNOS 2.0 website, and I have
   revamped the documentation on the installer.

 * lastly, updated the release history on what I did today ...

July 8, 2020
------------

 * had to fix a few things, the JNOS configuration was not working, because of
   a badly generated autoexec.nos - don't use rip() when copying from autoexec
   template file, so it's working now. Decided to create a dummy jnos (script)
   for the installer, since I don't ship generic binary anymore. The installer
   won't break then (due to lack of a binary). The script basically tells you
   to compile your own JNOS ... That should be it for now ...

August 3, 2020
--------------

 * bumped configure and makefile to 03Aug2020_v1.6, configure script checks
   for existence of #define RDATECLI and recommends to not use it anymore.

   config.h.default - now setting '#undef RDATECLI'

   version.c - bumped up to 2.0m.4

   tipmail.[ch] - the *Tiplist variable should never have been defined
   in header file, now a static variable in source file, was creating
   multiple define errors with GCC 10 (Manjero distro).
    (thanks to Kayne, N9SEO for reporting this).

   removed jnosinstaller from makefile (as noted on July 7) !

     -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   2579 Aug  3 16:10 configure*
     -r--r--r-- 1 root root   8357 Aug  3 16:09 makefile

     -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  14146 Aug  3 15:00 version.c

  This is the patch file I have put out after finishing up the above :

     makefile tipmail.[ch] config.h.default version.c
