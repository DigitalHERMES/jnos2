 Updated 13Mar2022, now have ability to switch heard lists !

 To switch to a new (or existing) heard list, you can do this now :

    ax25 h new=17m rp0

 to switch back to the original default, use :

    ax25 h new=rp0 rp0

 I will change the code later to new=default instead, that way
 there is no way to mess up the port name, or have to enter it
 twice.

 *** new RX only option ***

 iface.c
  new rx only option under ifconfig, soft switch to disable sending of data
  out the port, effectively disabling TX, mostly for my RPR stuff.

 *** VERY EXPERIMENTAL - 05Mar2022, Maiko (VE4KLM) ***

You probably won't see anything different, this is new code, and if anything
I just want people to try it out and make sure it is stable. From here, I am
planning on adding the ability to have multiple heard lists that you can switch
between per iface (port) - in case you want to change frequencis or bands on a
particular port, but keep the heard lists specific to the frequency or band.

The heard lists are not sorted from most recent to past in this version, BUT
you can 'ax25 h save crap', then immediately 'ax25 h load crap', to remedy.

These file can be copied over the LATEST official rsync, nothing earlier.

To use these changes, edit your makefile, and modify PATCHES as below :

   PATCHES = -fsigned-char -DKLM_HLREVAMP_2022

You have to do a MASS compile AFTER you edit your 'makefile', then :

   make clean
   ./configure
   make

Revamped Heard List code
------------------------

 Removal of the big 3 Lq, Ld, and Lv link lists

 Each interface now has it's own directly accessible link lists

 Added -DKLM_HLREVAMP_2022 to makefile to affect the changes !

 Seems to be working and stable on my test JNOS using live save file

 5:10 pm - all the above files copied to NEW /jnos/src/rsync/hlrevamp2022, and noting diffs :

 agwpe.c, asy.c, ax25.c, baycom.c, kiss.c, multipsk.c, pktdrvr.c, scc.c, winrpr.c 
  initialize 3 newly added iface struct hrd pointers
   (not sure if these will stay here, might store outside of structure still)

 iface.h
  3 new hrd list pointers in iface structure
   (not sure if these will stay here, might store outside of structure still)

 ax25.h
  new prototope for revamped SRC lookup function

 ax25cmd.c, axheard.c, jheard.c
  significant changes
   (start of a new ax25 heard subcommand, SET heardlist, stay tuned)

 rspf.c
   (using revamped SRC lookup function)

 axhsort.c
  not required anymore, heard list still needs sorts, but find other way to do it
