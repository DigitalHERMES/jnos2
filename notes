 differences between 2.0j.7v and 2.0j.7u - March 8, 2016
 -------------------------------------------------------

1) I am trying to improve the quality and usefulness of what is logged in the
   main JNOS log file during forwarding sessions, a work in progress, but I'd
   like to get an update out that might be of help to some folks.

   Files : fbbfwd.c, lzhuf.[ch], mailbox.c

2) Now logging subject and msgid in spool/mail.log file. I guess I should put
   in a flag for those who don't care to log this extra information (sorry).

   Files : smtpserv.c

3) Added debugging to try and figure out where the incoming message date and
   time (supposedly in CST) of a forwarded message are being taken from, and
   how it affects the indexing of the date for that message. This is strictly
   debugging, hopefully will be removed 'soon'.

   Files : index.c

4) Instructions (to generate a new JNOS binary) :

   rm fbbfwd.o, lzhuf.o mailbox.o, smtpserv.o index.o ; make
