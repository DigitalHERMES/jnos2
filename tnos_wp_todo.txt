bid_wp.c - TAKEN WHAT WAS NEEDED !!! - bid and wp expiry, not doing bid (yet)
 *note, I don't believe this is the same as message expiry (totally different)

config.c - DONE !!!

files.c - TAKEN WHAT WAS NEEDED !!!

mailbox2.c - TAKEN WHAT WAS NEEDED !!!

mailbox.c
map.c
pbbscmd.c
reqsvr.c - parseheader, getfield, rdaemon taken, that's all we need
smtpserv.c

tnosmap.c - main() program, not necessary right now

version.c

JNOS 2
------

01Feb2012

  makefile - added wpages.o in the servers section
  config.c - now has wpages -> dooldwpages (create a new wpages.c file)
  wpages.c - contains ONLY the wpages aspect of TNOS bid_wp.c file
  files.c - added stuff from TNOS files for WPAGES

  merge.c and sort.c - both TNOS source files required for this project, so
  need to add both to the makefile and edit them to include #ifdef WPAGES

02Feb2012

  makefile - added merge.o and sort.o (move sort.c from TNOS into JNOS src)
  clean compile now (good start) - next deal with DONT COMPILE parts !
  had to 'chmod o+r merge.c sort.c' they were not getting rsync'd :)

  okay, all DONT_COMPILE portions are dealt with, now to integrate
  the mailbox portions of the code.

  mboxfile.c - TNOS mailbox2.c - done !!! just have to put in dowhat()
       addition for the dombwpages stuff

  mailbox.c - take TNOS changes from mailbox.c as well

  mboxmail.c - also takes TNOS changes from mailbox.c as well
  -fixed a problem, brian uses buf, we use that damn tfile fp
  -also added #ifdef B2F to get the include file (b2f.h) to resolve
  the j2noB2F() prototype

these 2 don't seem important for us.
map.c
pbbscmd.c

smtpserv.c - this is a BIG one I think, so first check in the smtp gateway
             and exceptions code that I added for better gateway options,
             then check it out again for these new WPAGES changes - done!

TNOS has a separate get_msgid () TYPE, so messages and bulletins get
their own sequence number source. I don't think that's a big deal for
us, so just replace both TYPES with the same source (still unique).

version.c - done ! Just after noon time, preliminary version complete !!!

         just little bits to figure out, and maybe let people test it,
         but FIRST make a document (look at the TNOS docs) then release
         it for testing, with caveats about stuff not quite complete.

         actually test it first myself and see how it works.

  rm version.o smtpserv.o mboxmail.o mailbox.o mboxfile.o
  rm wpages.o sort.o merge.o files.o config.o
  vi config.h.default
  make
  rm config.h

* RESTART and play around with WPAGES NOW !!

February 4
----------

Try and get buildwp.c compiled and working, apparently creates wpages
entries by going through the entire spool/mail directory, using all of
the messages stored there. Not a bad idea actually, work on this.
TODO

Noticed that Lantz did not put everything under WPAGES directives, there
are alot of calls to wpages_exp that are not, so I initially missed many
of them while porting. Ongoing ...
