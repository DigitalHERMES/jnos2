 * 30Sep2019, Maiko (VE4KLM), libcrypt (-lcrypt) is no more with the latest
 * distributions of linux, so I am tossed whether to replace it or just get
 * rid of the encryption part, I mean the password is mangled to ascii 1 and
 * 0 values to begin with, so anyone looking at the password file will still
 * not be able to easily figure out the passwords stored in the file. So for
 * the time being, there is no more encryption of this file.
 *
 * The file has not changed, encryption has simply been disabled with :
 *
 *   #ifdef ENCRYPT_PASSWORD_BLOCK
 *
 * It just means you will have to wipe the /jnos/users directory and run
 * the j2pwmgr utility again to recreate the Winlink Secure Login passwd
 * information. Unfortunately the files in the directory from before are
 * not going to be compatible with this newest version, sorry for that.
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * New way to store passwords for JNOS related operations, this is came
 * about from the need to keep the passwords for Winlink Secure Login safe
 * from prying eyes. Then I got to thinking perhaps it's time to start doing
 * the same for general JNOS passwords (ie, ftpusers, popusers, etc) in the
 * near future (but not yet). That is why I introduced the 'type' field, 0
 * for Winlink Secure Login, and 1 for general JNOS passwords and so on.
 *
 * Designed and Coded during October of 2015 by Maiko Langelaar (VE4KLM)
 *
 * Compile & Run :
 *
 *    cc -DNOJ2STRLWR j2pwmgr.c j2pwrtns.c -o j2pwmgr
 *
 *  NOTE (30Sep2019), removed '-lcrypt' since we can't use it anymore !
 *
 *    ./j2pwmgr
 *
 * Add -DTESTPROGRAM to the cc arguments to compile and run test program.
 *
 * Based on ideas and code found in code forums and crypt man pages, including
 * a post from 'Wayne C. Morris, Dec 16, 2004' to 'thecodingforums', under the
 * thread 're-right-way-of-using-setkey-3-and-encrypt-3.436192', very useful.
